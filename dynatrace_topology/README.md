# Agent Check: Dynatrace Topology

## Overview

This check synchronizes [Dynatrace][1] smartscape topology through the StackState Agent. Currently supported Component Types are : 
* _Hosts_
* _Applications_
* _Processes_
* _Process-Groups_
* _Services_

## Setup

### Prerequisite

* An API Token from Dynatrace must have access to read the smartscape topology basically `DataExport` API value.

#### REST API Endpoints
The API Token configured in StackState Agent V2 must have access to read the topology. The permission name required for this API token is `Access problems and event feed, metrics, and topology`. The API endpoints used in the StackState Agent V2 are defined below:
* _/api/v1/entity/infrastructure/processes_
* _/api/v1/entity/infrastructure/hosts_
* _/api/v1/entity/applications_
* _/api/v1/entity/infrastructure/process-groups_
* _/api/v1/entity/services_

**NOTE** 
* Refer the Dynatrace documentation page on [how to create an API Token](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/api-authentication#generate-a-token)
* Read the Dynatrace documentation page on [permission required for your API Token](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/api-authentication#token-permissions)


### Installation

The Dynatrace Topology check is included in the [StackState Agent][2] package, so you do not
need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `dynatrace_topology.d/conf.yaml.example` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your
   Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your dynatrace performance data.
   See the [sample dynatrace_topology.d/conf.yaml.example][2] for all available configuration options.

2. Restart the Agent

## Data Collected

This integration collects topology of different component types from Dynatrace on each run. Currently, we gather all topology from the last 72 hours as per default.
